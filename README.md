## 👋🏽 About Me

I’m Angel Praise, an IT Support Technician and a dedicated learner in the **ALX Software Engineering Program**. My journey into software engineering began with a deep curiosity for how systems work and a desire to build tools that make everyday processes simpler and more efficient.

⚙️ With hands-on experience in IT support and growing skills in backend development, I bridge the gap between troubleshooting real-world issues and building scalable solutions.

🎯 My goal is to become a **backend developer**, and eventually transition into **technical project management**, where I can lead teams and shape the systems we build.

💡 I’m passionate about:
- Creating tools that improve people's daily experiences.
- Building systems that are secure, reliable, and scalable.
- Learning technologies that empower communities.

🏆 One of my early achievements was developing a **complaint management system** for university students, improving communication between them and administrators. I'm currently working on an **Airbnb Clone backend** using Django, DRF, PostgreSQL, and GraphQL as part of my ALX journey.

🚀 I’m excited to collaborate on meaningful projects—especially those focused on efficiency, education, or community impact.
